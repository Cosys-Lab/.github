## About Us
Cosys-Lab focuses on the Co-Design for Cyber-Physical Systems. Our research activities span a wide range, from the development of novel sensor techniques and embedded systems, through advanced modeling techniques, to the design of highly energy-efficient mechanisms.

Some examples of our case studies and application areas include:
 - Monitoring patients with respiratory syndromes using innovative sensor technology.
 - Developing localization and gas-leak detection systems inspired by bat research.
 - Creating cost-efficient design methodologies for embedded controllers, particularly for BLDC machines.
 - Implementing virtual hardware-in-the-loop (vHiL) verification techniques for robust system testing.
 - Optimizing the design of critical medical devices, such as emergency ventilators.
